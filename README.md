Tkinter GUI Cashier System Project Overview This is a simple, yet functional, Graphical User Interface (GUI) based Cashier System developed using Python's built-in tkinter library. It simulates a basic Point-of-Sale (POS) system, allowing a user (cashier) to manage customer transactions, calculate totals, apply discounts, and process payments.

This project was built to demonstrate fundamental application development principles, GUI programming, and robust data handling within a desktop environment.

Features Product Display: Clearly lists available products with their IDs, names, and prices.

Item Addition: Add items to the shopping cart by product ID or name, specifying quantity.

Real-time Cart Update: Displays current items in the cart with quantities, individual prices, and line totals.

Bill Summary: Automatically calculates and displays subtotal, applicable discounts, sales tax, and the final total bill.

Payment Processing: Allows input of amount paid and calculates change due.

Error Handling: Provides user-friendly messages for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric quantity, product not found).

Cart Management: Option to clear the current transaction cart.

Technologies Used Python 3.x: The core programming language.

Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit, used for building the graphical interface.

How to Run Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

Save the code: Save the provided code as cashier_system_tkinter.py.

Run from terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute:

python cashier_system_tkinter.py

Interact: The GUI window will appear. You can now use the system to add products, view the bill, and process payments.

Skills Demonstrated: This project showcases several key skills valuable for a Full Stack Developer with MySQL knowledge:

GUI Application Development: Proficiency in creating interactive and user-friendly graphical interfaces.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The system is structured using classes (CashierApp) to encapsulate functionality, demonstrating good design principles.

Event-Driven Programming: Handling user interactions (button clicks, text input) and updating the UI dynamically.

Core Application Logic: Implementing complex business rules, calculations, and data flow.

Data Management (In-Memory): Efficiently managing product and cart data using Python dictionaries and lists. This foundation is directly transferable to database interactions.

Error Handling & User Feedback: Implementing robust error checks and providing clear messages to the user, crucial for reliable applications.

Future Enhancements (Leveraging Full Stack & MySQL Skills) While this version uses an in-memory product database, it lays a strong foundation for future expansion. As a Full Stack Developer with MySQL expertise, I envision the following enhancements:

User Authentication: Implement a simple login system for cashiers, storing user credentials in MySQL.

Reporting Module: Generate detailed sales reports (daily, weekly, monthly) by querying the transaction history from the MySQL database.

Inventory Management: Add functionality to track product stock levels and update them after each sale.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
